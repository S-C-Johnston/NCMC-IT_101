##Lecture

CCNA vs CCNP:
CCNA is cisco targeted general network understanding. CCNP dives much deeper
into every topic, including security

Switches vs hubs
 - Hubs are deprecated technology, frequently experienced collisions, was not
   ideal.
 - Switches are current basic connection technology. Contains many distinct
   physical access ports which are partitioned logically, so no collisions
occur, and a pair of uplink ports.

Managed switches can implement VLAN (virtual local area network), to isolate
client devices. A console port, which used to be a special serial connection,
can be used to configure the switch when connected to a PC.

Port security: establishes specific MAC address allowance on physical
ports.

VLANs can logically isolate client machines into separate networks. The limit
of the number of VLANs depends on the hardware. The practical limit that
should be about maximum in use is 24.

Routers live on level 3 of the OSI model. They broadcast traffic and allow
different networks and subnets to talk to each other securely. Routers also
segregate multicast and broadcast traffic to prevent overloading across
networks.

Different kinds of traffic
 1. Unicast 1:1
 2. Multicast 1:m
   - Shares/replicates the same packets for multiple clients, which
     effectively shares bandwidth
 3. Broadcast 1:ALL
   - Replicates packets to all clients, which generates a lot of unique
     bandwidth
   - Useful for DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which needs to be
     allowed specifically.
