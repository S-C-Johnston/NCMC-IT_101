Challenges:

The cluster was a new feature to me, I wrongly assumed that the diagram showed
a cloud, and beat my head against that for a bit before I recognized that it
was a custom collection. Once I got that, it was fairly straightforward.

I set the DNS server to be the same as the web server, for simplicity sake.

Insofar as getting the behavior of the laptops attaching to the AP instead of
the WR, I had to futz with the physical layout in packet tracer to get it to
recognize what I was trying to do. Once I did, that almost immediately
resolved.
